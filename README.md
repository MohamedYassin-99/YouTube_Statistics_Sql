YouTube contains tons of data, and itâ€™s always easy to ask questions about it
-What are the most commented-upon videos? Or the most liked?
-How many total views does each category have? How many likes?
-What are the most-liked comments?
-What is the ratio of views/likes per video? Per each category?
-What is the average sentiment score in each keyword category?
-How many times do company names (i.e., Apple or Samsung) appear in each keyword category?
